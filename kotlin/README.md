### How to run the app on an emulator

Run the app in an emulator as follows:

1. Clone or download the example project you want and import it as a project in Android Studio. 
2. If you don't have an Android Virtual Device (AVD), create it so the emulator can use it to install and run the app.
3. In the toolbar, select your app from the run and debug configurations dropdown menu.
4. From the target device dropdown menu, select the AVD on which you want to run the app.
5. Click Run.

Android Studio installs the app on the AVD and then starts the emulator.
